# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Data
This my first project to analyze tweets data by R and Twitter APIs.
I re-organized my codes and other related stuff here.  
Hope it's helpful for someone.

api_key, api_secret, token, token_secret are all got from dev.twitter.com  
You'd better put them into a configure file instead of directly using in codes.
