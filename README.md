# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Data
This my first project to analyze tweets data by R and Twitter APIs.
I re-organized my codes and other related stuff here.  
Hope it's helpful for someone.

api_key, api_secret, token, token_secret are all got from dev.twitter.com  
You'd better put them into a configure file instead of directly using in codes.

## Summary:
•	Analyzed people’s attitudes towards Taylor Swift and Kanye West’s feud by text mining on followers’ replies   
•	Fetched followers’ replies on Taylor and Kanye’s Tweets, preprocessed those tweets, extracted positive and negative representing words, drew a word cloud for people’s attitudes  
•	Used Naïve Bayes to predict the attitude of an arbitrary reply to Taylor Swift or Kanye West’s tweets
